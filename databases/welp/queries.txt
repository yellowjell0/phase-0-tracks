You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
SELECT * FROM reviews
LEFT JOIN business ON reviews.business_id = business.id
LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.users_id = users.id;

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
SELECT
reviews.id AS reviews_id,
reviews.stars AS reviews_stars,
reviews.comments AS reviews_comments,
business.name AS business_name,
users.last_name AS users_last_name,
users.first_name AS users_first_name
FROM
reviews
LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.users_id = users.id
LEFT JOIN business ON reviews.business_id = business.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews
LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.users_id = users.id
LEFT JOIN business ON reviews.business_id = business.id
WHERE name="Fred's Fried Chicken";
