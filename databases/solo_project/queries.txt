Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
SELECT * FROM HOTSPOTS;

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
UPDATE HOTSPOTS SET open_for_dinner="False" WHERE restaurant_name="The Couch Potato";

Display the information in both tables using one query.
SELECT * FROM HOTSPOTS, DIETS WHERE HOTSPOTS.diet_id = DIETS.id;    

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
SELECT HOTSPOTS.restaurant_name, HOTSPOTS.open_for_lunch, HOTSPOTS.open_for_dinner, DIETS.diet_type FROM HOTSPOTS JOIN DIETS ON HOTSPOTS.diet_id = DIETS.id;

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
DELETE FROM HOTSPOTS WHERE id = 1;

Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

CROSS JOIN - 
SELECT restaurant_name, open_for_lunch, open_for_dinner FROM HOTSPOTS CROS JOIN DIETS;

INNER JOIN - 
SELECT restaurant_name, open_for_lunch, open_for_dinner, diet_type FROM HOTSPOTS INNER JOIN DIETS ON HOTSPOTS.diet_id = DIETS.id;

OUTER JOIN - 
SELECT restaurant_name, open_for_lunch, open_for_dinner, diet_type FROM HOTSPOTS LEFT OUTER JOIN DIETS ON HOTSPOTS.diet_id = DIETS.id;
