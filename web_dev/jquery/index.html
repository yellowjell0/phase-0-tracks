	<p id="intro">Beer has long since been a passion of mine. Ever since my dad snuck me that first sip when mom wasn't looking, I've been captivated by the complexity and culture that is apart of brewing and enjoying beer. This page will shine some insight on beer, hopefully giving you a better understanding of what you and I sometimes over indulge in.</p>

		<h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <div>
		Traditional (German) beers use 4 ingredients; water, yeast, malt and hops. Your fancy schmancy new age beers add <i>adjuncts</i> to the mix (can be anything, from chocolate to a gym sock) 
    </div>
    <h4> Step 1 </h4>
		<div>
			You start by germinating your malt, usually done by soaking it in water until it starts to sprout
		</div>
    <h5> Step 2</h5>
		<div>
			You then roast your malt. The longer the roast, the darker the beer
		</div>
    <h6> Step 3 </h6>
		<div>
			Next, boil your malt in water and say "Double double, toil and trouble" (the quote is optional)
		</div>		
    <h7> Step 4 </h7>
    <div>
    Add some hops to the boiling malt. This is going to give your beer that lovely bitter taste depending on how much you use
		</div>
    <h8> Step 5 </h8>
		<div>
		Now your <i>wart</i> is ready for cooling. Take a break. You've earned it.
		</div>
      <h9> Step 6 </h9>
		<div>
			Introduce yeast, whether a particular strain or from the air. Regions play a huge part in the flavor profile of beer. So depending on where your yeast is from, beer flavor will vary.
		</div>
    <h10> Step 7 </h10>
		<div>
			Now you cover (optional) and wait. The yeast will eat the natural sugars from the malt and create CO2 and the magical substance we like to call alcohol. This can take a while, so you might want to put on The Lord Of The Rings... like, all of them. 
		</div>
    <h11> Step 8 </h11>
		<div>
			Now you're ready to bottle. Most brewers add a little more sugar to each bottle to add more CO2.
		</div>
    <h12> Step 9 </h12>
		<div>
			The last step is to invite me over so that I can judge your concoction.
		</div>
