The player enters a word as the initialization argument. That word becomes the secret word
The player attempts to solve the word by gessing letters, which return in the string if the letter is in the word.
Repeated guesses do not count against the player.
The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. So if the secret word is "unicorn", the player will start out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the player enters a guess of "c".
The player should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.
